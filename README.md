# TAG-RSOM-Vessel-Analysis

This pipeline enables the quantification of colon vessels in mice imaged with TAG-RSOM. For a more detailed description read the work associated with this repository (AUTHOR, TITLE, JOURNAL, YEAR, DOI)

## Requirements for running the code

This software uses the ImageJ distribution Fiji (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads) and Jupyter (https://jupyter.org/install).

## How to:

1.  Organize your reconstructed volumes.tif in a input folder.
2.  Run `main.ijm` in Fiji.
3.  Run `descriptors_calculation.ipynb` to fetch results and calculate descriptors.
